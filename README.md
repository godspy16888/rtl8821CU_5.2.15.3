# rtl8821CU_5.2.15.3
Android/Linux driver for rtl8821CU_5.2.15.3
All driver files were packed as my git account limitaion.
May somebody can clone it and try it on TI's AM335x platform such as Beaglebone's BBBlack/BBblue/PocketBeagle.
Actually i didn't see the relative "platform" for TI's AM335x series int he Makefile...
But may this not essensial.
